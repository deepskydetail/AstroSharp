For your convenience, I have included a prebuilt ChromePasswords.dll in
Release.  However you may build it yourself if you wish.

Prerequisites:
- NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)
- SQLite3 source (http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3_6_20.zip)

I used Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 to build.  Sorry users of previous VS, but I
don't think the solution/project file formats work with earlier versions,
you'll have to recreate them.  Here's the appropriate settings to use (VS2010
users will still have to fix paths in the project settings).

- Turn off Precompiled Headers.
- Add NSIS\Examples\Plugin\nsis and the extracted SQLite3 source as include
  directories to the project.
- Calling convention MUST be __cdecl (should be the default).
- Add NSIS\Examples\Plugin\nsis as a library directory to the project.
- Add crypt32.lib and pluginapi.lib (from NSIS) as linker dependancies.
- Set ChromePasswords.def as the Module Definition File.
- If you are using VS2008 or above, you may get an error on compile complaining
  of a missing LIBC.LIB.  As I understand it, this occurs because pluginapi.lib
  was compiled with an older VS and LIBC.LIB is not needed with the newer ones.
  You can add LIBC.LIB to the "Ignore Specific Default Libraries" linker
  option to suppress this error.
- Add sqlite3.c from the SQLite3 source to the project.
