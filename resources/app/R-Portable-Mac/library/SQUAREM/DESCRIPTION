Title: Squared Extrapolation Methods for Accelerating EM-Like Monotone
        Algorithms
Description: Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow,
        monotone sequences from smooth, contraction mapping such as the
        EM algorithm. It can be used to accelerate any smooth, linearly
        convergent acceleration scheme.  A tutorial style introduction
        to this package is available in a vignette on the CRAN download
        page or, when the package is loaded in an R session, with
        vignette("SQUAREM").
