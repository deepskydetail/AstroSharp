    CHANGES IN bit64 VERSION 0.9-7

BUG FIXES

    o All .Call routines are now registered



    CHANGES IN bit64 VERSION 0.9-6

NEW FEATURES

    o New method str.integer64 shows the integer64 
      and no longer the underlying double
      (wish of Matt Dowle)
    o New integer64 methods is.nan, is.finite, is.infinite
      (wish of Florent Angly


USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o as.integer64.double and as.double.integer64
      now have an argument keep.names=FALSE
      (wish of Dirk Edelb√ºttel and Leonardo Silvestri)

	
BUG FIXES

    o We now protect our SEXP return-vector before calling R_Busy
      (reported by Thjomas Kalibera)
    o median.integer64 now gets a ... argument if the generic has it
      (wish of Kurt Hornik)
    o we migrated all files to UTF-8

    

    CHANGES IN bit64 VERSION 0.9-5

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The following functions are converted to S3 generics and mask package:base
      :, is.double, match, %in%, rank, order
    o NA_integer64_ is now available and exported

	
BUG FIXES

    o ramsort.integer64 no longer complains about misssing return 
      value when stable || optimize == "time" (reported by Dan Southern)
    o removed a harmless warning on request of CRAN maintainers
      gcc had complained about using %lli format which is not 
      supported under the windows MCPP compiler, under which
      %lli and thus as.character.integer64 will fail.
    o now uses R's RNG instead of the system RNG

    

    CHANGES IN bit64 VERSION 0.9-4

BUG FIXES

    o The packages now uses clone(x) instead of x[]
    o log(x) tests no longer fail under valgrind
      (Thanks to Heisenberg it only failed under Valgrind)
    o UBSAN should no longer complain about left shift

    

    CHANGES IN bit64 VERSION 0.9-3

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The following functions are converted to S3 generics and mask package:base
      :, is.double, match, %in%, rank, order
    o table.integer64 now automatically converts non-integer64 arguments to integer64
      rather than stopping on error (but gives a warning for each column) 
    o table.integer64 called with return="table" returns empty cells now with 
      0 rather than NA
    o %in%.integer64 no longer has arguments 'nunique' and 'method' in order
      to match the generic with only two arguments 'x', 'table' and ...


BUG FIXES

    o c(x,x,x) failed with integer64 type because R no longer copies the 
      arguments in list(...) as from R-3.0.2 . Presumably now the ugly 
      workaround in table.integer64 is no longer needed but that has NOT 
      been fixed yet
    o round.integer64 no longer removes the "integer64" class attribute
      (reported by Dan Southern)

    

    CHANGES IN bit64 VERSION 0.9-2

BUG FIXES

    o match.integer64 (and %in%.integer64) now call correctly with 
      method="hashpos" and method="hashrev"
    o removed platform specific timing code that was not needed 
      and prevented compiling under MacOS


    

    CHANGES IN bit64 VERSION 0.9-1

    
NEW FEATURES

    o new methods for 'match', '%in%', 'duplicated', 'unique', 'table'
      , 'sort', 'order', 'rank', 'quantile', 'median' and 'summary'
    o new generics and methods for data management: 
        'unipos' (positions of the unique values)
      , 'tiepos' (positions of ties)
      , 'keypos' (positions of values in a sorted unique table) 
      and derived methods 'as.factor' and 'as.ordered'
    o new generic caching scheme, see ?cache and ?hashcache
    o new low level functions for fast sorting, ordering and hashing,
    see ?sortnut and ?hashmap

    
    
USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o the package is back on CRAN. Method 'as.vector.integer64' has been removed 
      at request of the CRAN maintainer. The starting point for this request was: 
      'matrix(integer64())' does not work. The result of removing 
      'as.vector.integer64' is a deterioration: 'array(integer64())' does not work 
      anymore. You can restore 'as.vector.integer64' if you prefer.
    o package 'bit64' now shares generics for low-level sorting with package 'ff' 
      and depends on package 'bit' for those generics
      


      
    CHANGES IN bit64 VERSION 0.8-3


FIXES

    o removed chonst char warning (thanks to Murray Stokely)
    o reduced R dependency down to version 2.12.1 (wish of Murray Stokely)
