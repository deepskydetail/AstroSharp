Description: True boolean datatype (no NAs), 
  coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; 
  fast boolean operators and fast summary statistics. 
  With 'bit' vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the 
  expense of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less 
  RAM and ~ factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of 
  R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains 
  for vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations 
  it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such 
  components are used more than once. 
  Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing 
  standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package 
  allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call() 
  directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector 
  memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the time for copying 
  from logical to logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a 
  performance penalty of 150%. the package now contains further classes for 
  representing logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and 
  'ri' for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing. All three index 
  classes can be used for subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).
