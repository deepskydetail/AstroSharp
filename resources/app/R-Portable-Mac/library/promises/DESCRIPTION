Description: Provides fundamental abstractions for doing asynchronous programming
    in R using promises. Asynchronous programming is useful for allowing a single
    R process to orchestrate multiple tasks in the background while also attending
    to something else. Semantics are similar to 'JavaScript' promises, but with a
    syntax that is idiomatic R.
