   <!-- Simple test of including a set of nodes from an XML document -->

Works:
   xinclude:include href="something.xml" xpointer="element(/1/2)"  parse="xml"

   xinclude:include href="something.xml#xpointer(/1/2)"
   xinclude:include href="something.xml" xpointer="/1/2"


Fails
/doc/1
/doc

 xinclude:include href="something.xml#xpointer(author)"

TEST
   <xinclude:include href="something.xml" xpointer="/1"/>

   <xinclude:include href="something.xml" xpointer="element(/doc)"  parse="xml">
    <xinclude:fallback><p>My own <i>substitute</i> text</p></xinclude:fallback>
   </xinclude:include>
</x>
