2006-01-23: 1.0-0 first version uploaded on CRAN.
2006-04-26: 1.0-1 fixed a bug of non-compliance to R programming standards.
2006-10-09: 1.1-0 adopt amedend Fortran code of Alan Genz (subtroutine TRESTR).
2006-10-26: 1.2-0 fixed a bug in function rmt.
2007-03-16: 1.2-1 some amendments in documentation.
2008-06-12: 1.3-0 added Fortran code for the bivariate case; improved R coding.
2009-01-26: 1.3-2 minor modification to F77 code to avoid GOTO out of IF block.
2009-03-21: 1.3-3 removed check on the R version on request of the R Core team.
2009-11-25: 1.3-4 fixed a bug affecting the case d>2 & df=Inf.
2011-01-16: 1.4-0 pd.solve() introduced; argument 'mean' can now be a matrix
  for {d,p}mnorm and {d,p}mt.
2011-04-06: 1.4-1 fixed documentation; coding of dmnorm & dmt is straightened;
  log.det in pd.solve() is returned only on request.
2011-04-28: 1.4-2 fixed bug of biv.not.prob if some (lower=-Inf & upper=Inf).
2011-05-03: 1.4-3 fixed bug as above for sadmvn and sadmvt.
2012-01-06: 1.4-5 NAMESPACE introduced on request by the R Core Team.
2013-12-04: 1.4-7 .First.lib() removed on request from CRAN, other minor fixes.
2014-06-25: 1.5-0 improved coding of dmnorm and dmt functions (avoids 'apply');
  allow calling pmnorm and pmt with a matrix argument 'x'.
2014-06-30: 1.5-1 fixes a bug of parameter checking in dmnorm and dmt
2015-04-02: 1.5-2 new argument 'sqrt' of dmnorm and dmt; limited check of 
  the arguments is introduced (earlier skipped for speed); calls to rmt with
  a smaller/larger of 'n' generate a sub/superset of values.
2015-05-25: 1.5-3 rmt and rmnorm output with d=1 have now the same structure;
  improved checks on arguments supplied to dmnorm and dmt.                  
2016-03-08: 1.5-4 improved NAMESPACE and documentation; more flexible use of 
  mean in {d,p,r}mnorm and {d,p,r}mt; pd.solve transfers dimnames(x) to output.
2016-10-15: 1.5-5 fix a bug in rmt
