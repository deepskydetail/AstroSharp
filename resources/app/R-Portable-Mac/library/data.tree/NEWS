  - now generates auto name if unique name is not available (#54)
  - now has warn arg, warning if source data contains reserved names

- ADD: Find method to find a single Node in a (sub-)tree (#52)

## Version 0.3.0 Pine Tree

  - ADD: Clone (returning a deep copy)
  - ADD: Prune (pruning the tree)
