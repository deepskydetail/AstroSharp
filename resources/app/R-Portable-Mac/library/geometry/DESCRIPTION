Description: Makes the qhull library (www.qhull.org)
    available in R, in a similar manner as in Octave and MATLAB. Qhull
    computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
    intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
    Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
    runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements the
    Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull does not
    support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of
    non-convex objects, but the package does include some R functions
    that allow for this. Currently the package only gives access to
    Delaunay triangulation and convex hull computation.
