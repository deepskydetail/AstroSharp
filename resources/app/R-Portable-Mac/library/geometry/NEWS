CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3-6 - Released 2015/09/04

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* As per CRAN policies, the title in the DESCRIPTION file is now in title
  case.

BUG FIXES

* Fix for Issue #5738: segfault when run from directory lacking write
  permission
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=5738&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  Using "." as a temporary directory can cause problems if it is not
  writeable. Now the geometry package uses tempdir(), which R should
  guarantee to exist.
  Thanks to Laura Riggi for reporting this problem.

* Put Robert B. Gramacy back in the author list, after he was
  accidentally omitted when changing to the Authors@R format on
  2014/10/29 (version 0.3-5).
  Thanks to Robert B. Gramacy for reporting this, and apologies for
  the error.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3-5 - Released 2014/11/06

API CHANGES

* The default Qhull option to the delaunayn() function is now "Qt"
  rather than "QJ" and degenerate (zero-area) simplices are removed
  from the triangulation, so that all simplicies are non-degenerate.
  This is a follow-up to issue #2009: delaunayn can return degenerate
  simplicies by default
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1993&group_id=1149&atid=4552). Thanks
  to Rolf Turner for alerting me to the issue. 

* delaunayn() now throws an error if the number of points is less than
  the number of dimensions + 1.

FEATURES

* delaunayn() with the "full" option also returns the areas of
  facets. This is a byproduct of the API change above.

BUG FIXES

* Fix for Issue #2789: inline functions min/max generate linker error
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2789&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  Thanks to Bernd Bischl for reporting the problem and suggesting the
  fix.

* Partial Fix for Issue #5738: segfault when run from directory
  lacking write permission
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=5738&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  An error is now thrown, rather than a segfault. The underlying
  problem still needs to be dealth with.

DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS

* The meanings of "area" and "vol" in the convhulln return value have
  been clarified. Thanks to Michael Cole for raising the issue.

* The documentation of "cart2bary" and "bary2cart" has been corrected
  and improved. Thanks to Francisco Mendoza Torres for raising the issue.

* HTML documentation has been for validation errors with HTML tidy.
  Thanks to Kurt Hornik and the CRAN maintainers for alerting me to
  the problem.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* Tests are now all done using the testthat framework.

* There is now a test to make sure output to file works. Thanks to
  Brian Ripley for identifying the problem while testing the pacakge
  for CRAN.

  LICENSE file made clearer. Thanks to Kurt Hornik and the CRAN
  maintainers for alerting me to the problem and helping with a
  solution.

* Fix for Issue #1993: Error in solve.default in
  tsearchn
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1993&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  Thanks to Bill Denny for reporting this and suggesting a way forward
  with a fix. Thanks to John Drake for alerting me to the recurrence
  of the problem and Jon Clayden on the R-devel list for pointing out
  the correct way of testing for ill-conditioned matrices.

* Fix for Issue #2009: delaunayn can return degenerate simplicies by
  default
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1993&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  This is a follow-on of #1993, so thanks to Bill Denny for
  highlighting the issue.

* Fix for Issue #2007: Qt option given to Qhull
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2007&group_id=1149&atid=4552)

* The use of the multicore package in tests has been replaced by use
  of the parallel package. Thanks to Kurk Hornik for pointing this
  out.

* Removed non-API call to R_TempDir.  Thanks to Kurk Hornik for
  pointing this out.

   R in the same directory: output to qhull_out.txt removed
   (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1578&group_id=1149&atid=4552).

 * Fix for Issue #1924: Silent operation is not supported (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1924&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
   Thanks to Raphael Leblois for reporting this.

 * Fix for Issue #1930:	delaunayn should always return a matrix (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1930&group_id=1149&atid=4552)

   Thanks to Petr Savicky for reporting this.

OTHER CHANGES

 * Updated to qhull version 2011.2.

 * The default qhull option "QJ" for delaunayn() has been replaced by
   "Qt". One or other option is always provided to the qhull code (see
   https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1915&group_id=1149&atid=4552).

 * Documentation improvements.

 * Added some tests.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2-0  - Released 2011/09/09

NEW FEATURES

 * The tsearch and tsearchn functions have been ported from
   Octave. These functions have the same syntax as the Octave
   versions, though it also possible to get tsearch to output
   barycentric coordinates. tsearch only works for 2D simplexes
   (i.e. triangles), but is fast because it is written in C. By
   default, tsearchn uses the fast tsearch function when presented
   with 2D data.

NEW MAINTAINER

 * David Sterratt has taken over from Bobby Gramacy. Thank-you to
   Bobby for his work on the package.
