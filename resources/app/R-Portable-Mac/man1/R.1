.SH NAME
R \- a language for data analysis and graphics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B R
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fI< infile\fR] [\fI> outfile\fR]
.br
.B R
\fICMD command \fR[\fIarguments\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Start R, a system for statistical computation and graphics, with the
specified options, or invoke an R tool via the 'R CMD' interface.
.PP
R is a language which bears a passing resemblance to the S language
developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories.  It provides support for a variety
of statistical and graphical analyses.  R is a true computer language
which contains a number of control-flow constructions for iteration and
alternation.  It allows users to add additional functionality by
defining new functions.
.LP
On systems which have the GNU \fBreadline\fP(3) library, R will maintain
a command history, so that commands can be recalled, edited and
re-executed.
.SH OPTIONS

Most options control what happens at the beginning and at the end of an
R session, in particular which files are being read and written, and how
much memory is reserved for the R process.
