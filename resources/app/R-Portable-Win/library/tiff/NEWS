NEWS/Changelog

0.1-11	2022-01-31
    o	add Windows UCRT support


0.1-10	2021-11-05
    o	Silence benign warnings in some compilers.


0.1-9	2021-08-13
    o	bugfix: readTIFF(..., native=TRUE) returned incorrect results when
	the all parameter was used to pick individual images. (#10)


0.1-8	2021-03-31
    o	add support for readTIFF(..., payload=FALSE) which only retrieves
	metadata information from the file

    --	The following features have been inspired or ported from
	https://github.com/akoyabio/tiff fork by Kent Johnson:

    o	Add limited support for tiled images. Supports 8-, 16- and 32-bit
	integer and float images with spp=1 or 3. No support for indexed,
	color map, as.is, or planar format color.

    o	add the ability to read (or get info on) selected images by passing
	a vector in the `all` parameter

    o	add width, length, x.position, y.position, and, if available,
	rows.per.strip, tile.width, tile.length to the directory
	info returned when `info=TRUE`.

    o	stop with an error if `as.is=TRUE` is used with a float image

    o	fixed documentation typos

    o	writeTIFF() uses path.expand() on supplied path

0.1-7	2021-02-04
    o	unix: use autoconf to detect libtiff flags to support
	static builds and optional tiff capabilities

    o	add C-level function registration

    o	minor updates to DESCRIPTION

0.1-5	2013-09-03
    o	bugfix: output of readTIFF(..., as.is=TRUE) with integer
	values was shifted by one (i.e., stored integer value x
	was returned as x + 1)

    o	writeTIFF() now supports 32-bit (integer) output

    o	writeTIFF() issues a warning if the input data range
	is outside [0, 1]

0.1-4	2013-02-19
    o	remove debugging output (it is now only shown if tiff
	is compiled with -DTIFF_DEBUG=1)

0.1-3	2012-11-05
    o	add support for 12-bit grayscale TIFF images in readTIFF()
	(Note that 12-bit TIFFs are outside of the standard, so
	we assume big-endian packing order)

    o	add readTIFF(..., as.is=TRUE) which preserves the integer
	values used in the TIFF as they are (if applicable) instead
	of rescaling to reals

0.1-2	2012-08-30
    o	fixed a bug in writeTIFF() for 16-bit images


0.1-1	2012-08-24
    o	add readTIFF(..., indexed=TRUE) which return indexed images as
	color map and an index matrix.

    o	fixed a bug in writing a TIFF file consisting of multiple
	subimages

    o	prevent TIFF from re-entering error calls


0.1-0	2012-08-04
    o	first CRAN release
