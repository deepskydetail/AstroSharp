NEWS/Changelog

0.1-8	2022-11-29
    o	minor change to avoid protect and registration warnings


0.1-7	2013-12-03
    o	fix endianness issue in writePNG() on big-endian machines
	when using nativeRaster


0.1-6	2013-07-02
    o	add support for text tags as well as R object metadata
	which is serialized into the text field
	(Thanks to Duncan Temple Lang for the idea)


0.1-5	2013-06-03
    o	add dpi and asp to writePNG() which allows to store the
	image resolution or aspect ratio (via the sPHYs PNG tag).

    o	add info flag to readPNG() which interprets some optional
	tags to return additional information such as dpi, asp
	or gamma if stored.

    o	try to detect local libpng via LOCAL_SOFT on Windows.
	Note that if you use LOCAL_SOFT, you are taking full
	responsibility over the libraries that png will be linked
	against.


0.1-4	2011-12-10
    o	writePNG() now supports binary connection as target and the
	default target is now raw()


0.1-3	2011-09-02
    o	remove debugging output

    o	added a missing call to png_set_interlace_handling to allow
	libpng to de-interlace images

    o	prevent warnings in readPNG() example for the windows device
	which is incapable of any transparency


0.1-2	2011-01-19
    o	support raw array as input to writePNG (RGBA only)

    o	do not truncate 16-bit images in readPNG() if the resulting
	output is not nativeRaster

    o	Windows binary on RForge has been updated to libpng 1.5.0


0.1-1	2010-04-06
    o	add tolerance to writePNG() to avoid shifts by one in
	color because of numerical representation of discretized
	values

    o	adapt to a last-minute change in R 2.11.0 from raster() to
	rasterImage()

    o	add support for more efficient nativeRaster format


0.1-0	2010-03-17
    o	first release on CRAN, supports readPNG() and writePNG()
	for files and raw vectors. readPNG() supports any input
	color type but will convert to 1-4 planes with 8-bit
	accuracy each. writePNG() will write out 1-4 planes
	8-bit each. writePNG() has currenty no provision for
	generating or stroring a palette.
