You won't see this R output, but it will run. <% foo <- 'bar' %>
Now foo is <%=foo%> and today is <%=format(Sys.time(),'%B %d, %Y')%>.
<%# Comment -- ignored -- useful in testing. 
    Also notice the dash-percent-gt.
    It chops off the trailing newline. 
    You can add it to any percent-gt. -%>
How about generating a template from a template?
<%% 
	foo <- 'fee fi fo fum' 
	brew <- 'haha'
%%>
foo is still <%=foo%>.
Contents of current directory:
<% print(dir()) %>
