Description: Basic wavelet routines for time series (1D), image (2D) and array 
  (3D) analysis.  The code provided here is based on wavelet methodology 
  developed in Percival and Walden (2000); Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001); 
  the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) from Kingsbury (1999, 2001) as
  implemented by Selesnick; and Hilbert wavelet pairs (Selesnick 2001, 2002).  
  All figures in chapters 4-7 of GSW (2001) are reproducible using this package 
  and R code available at the book website(s) below.
