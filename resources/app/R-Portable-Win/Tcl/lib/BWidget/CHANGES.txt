BWidget 1.1 (03/12/1999)

CHANGES FROM 1.0 TO 1.1

WHAT'S NEW

The most important change in BWidget 1.1 is the support
of tk path command, but the old syntax is always available.
configure command now returns a valid configuration information list.

(I hope that) All submitted bugs have been corrected.

Following widget have been reworked:

* ListBox:
    - ListBox items have now a -indent option.
    - insert command modified to look more as a tk
      listbox insert command (see  INCOMPATIBILITIES)
    - item command added to retreive one or more items

* Tree:
    - insert command modified to look more as a
      listbox insert command (see  INCOMPATIBILITIES)

* LabelEntry:
    - -value and -variable options renamed to -text and -textvariable
      (see  INCOMPATIBILITIES)

* SpinBox and ComboBox:
    - -value and -variable options renamed to -text and -textvariable
      (see  INCOMPATIBILITIES)
    - New command getvalue and setvalue added to manipulate
      current value by index.

* NoteBook:
    - Pages have now an identifier.
    - insert command modififed (see  INCOMPATIBILITIES)
    - page command added to retreive one or more pages
    - getframe command added


INCOMPATIBILITIES (sorry for this)

* LabelEntry, SpinBox and ComboBox:
    - -value and -variable options renamed to -text and -textvariable

* Entry and LabelEntry:
    - setfocus doesn't exist anymore. Directly use tk command focus.

* NoteBook:
    - Pages have now an identifier, which modifies insert command:
        NoteBook::insert $nb index ?option value ...?
      is now
        $nb insert index page ?option value ...?

* Tree:
    - insert command modified:
        Tree::insert $nb $parent $node $index ?option value ...?
      becomes
        $tree insert $index $parent $node ?option value ...?

* ListBox:
    - insert command modified:
        ListBox::insert $list $item $index ?option value ...?
      becomes
        $list insert $index $item ?option value ...?
