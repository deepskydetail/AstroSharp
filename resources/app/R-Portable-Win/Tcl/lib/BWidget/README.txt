WHAT IS BWIDGET ?

The BWidget Toolkit is a high-level Widget Set for Tcl/Tk built using
native Tcl/Tk 8.x namespaces.

The BWidgets have a professional look&feel as in other well known
Toolkits (Tix or Incr Widgets), but the concept is radically different
because everything is pure Tcl/Tk.  No platform dependencies, and no
compiling required.  The code is 100% Pure Tcl/Tk.

The BWidget library was originally developed by UNIFIX Online, and
released under both the GNU Public License and the Tcl license.
BWidget is now maintained as a community project, hosted by
Sourceforge.  Scores of fixes and enhancements have been added by
community developers.  See the ChangeLog file for details.
