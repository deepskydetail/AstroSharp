## Instructions

1) You can only upload TIFF files 
2) Because this is in beta stage, the files cannot be larger than ~~600kb~~ ... Really Big! 
3) The image can be color or black and white (but make sure you specify!) 
4) The image cannot have an alpha channel 
5) You probably shouldn't upload a sharpened image. Just upload a calibrated, stretched image 
With more development, I hope to make the app accept color images, large files etc. Help make astronomy accessible!
