## Instructions

1) You can only upload TIFF files 
2) Because this is in beta stage, the files cannot be larger than ~~600kb~~ ... Really Big! 
3) The image should be in black and white 
4) The image cannot have an alpha channel 
5) Do not sharpen your image before uploading it. Just upload a calibrated, stretched image tags 
With more development, I hope to make the app accept color images, large files etc. Help make astronomy accessible!
