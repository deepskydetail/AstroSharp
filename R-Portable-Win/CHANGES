Windows-specific changes to R

CHANGES IN R VERSIONS > 2.15.0:

  * Windows-specific changes will now be announced in the common NEWS
    file.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.15.0:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The 32-bit and 64-bit builds are now treated equally, as it is
      anticipated that 64-bit R will soon be (if not already) the more
      commonly used.  This entails:

      The Rterm or Rgui title mentions 32-bit as well as 64-bit.

      The desktop icons are labelled R i386 and R x64.

      R CMD INSTALL for a package with compiled code will fail if
      compilation fails for any of the installed sub-architectures: use
      --no-multiarch to override this.

    * postscript(file = "|cmd") now works on Windows.

    * file.symlink() is now implemented on NTFS file systems on Vista
      or later, for accounts which have suitable permissions (and most
      will not).  It can link existing directories, and existing-or-not
      files.

    * There is a new function Sys.junction() to create junction points
      on NTFS file systems.

    * C-level error formats now use the trio library, and so for
      example output 1.53e-11 (as required by C99) rather than
      1.53e-011.

  INSTALLER:

    * The installer has many fewer options with more files always being
      installed, as a few Mb of file space is nowadays no longer an
      issue.

    * It is now possible to select '64-bit Files' from the standard
      installer even on a 32-bit version of Windows.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * As the current toolchain uses only 32-bit executables, it is
      possible to compile a package for both architectures on 32-bit
      Windows provided both architectures of R have been installed: use
      Rcmd INSTALL --compile-both.

    * Rcmd INSTALL --merge-multiarch will work (but do a normal
      install) if only one architecture is installed.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Due to a race condition, some graphics changes were not flushed
      to the display if another graphics window was closed at nearly
      the same time.  (Reported by Michael Sumner.)

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.2:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * bitmap() and dev2bitmap() look for gswin64c.exe (as used by
      64-bit GhostScript), in preference to gswin32c.exe.

  INSTALLATION:

    * The sources (and packages) can now be compiled using the multilib
      toolchain developed for R 2.15.x: see the MULTI macro in
      MkRules.dist.  This toolchain is used for the CRAN binary
      distribution.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * The preferred toolchain has changed since the one used for R
      2.12.0 to 2.14.1: see the'R Installation and Administration
      manual'.  Compiled code (except DLLs) may be incompatible with
      previous toolchains (and compiled C++ code almost certainly will
      be: users of Rcpp take care).

      Ensure that the settings in MkRules.local are appropriate to the
      toolchain you use.

    * There is a new macro (aka make variable) SHLIB_PTHREAD_FLAGS.
      This is set to -pthread on builds using toolchains which support
      it, and should be included in both PKG_CPPFLAGS (or the Fortran
      or F9x equivalents) and PKG_LIBS.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Using a prompt of more than 80 characters in readline() could
      cause a buffer overflow in Rterm.  (Reported by Henrik
      Bengtsson.)

    * Some of the custom messages in the installer were corrupted: add
      a BOM mark to the file as now required by Unicode Inno Setup.
      (PR#14816)

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The Save as menu item on the script editor adds extension .R to a
      file name without an extension.

    * In package parallel, detectCores(logical = FALSE) makes an
      OS-dependent attempt to find the number of physical cores.  It
      usually succeeds, even on XP.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * The directory pointed to by USER_LOCAL can now have
      architecture-specific sub-directories lib/i386 and lib/x64.

  BUG FIXES:

    * The fix for PR#14543 caused stack problems with outputting large
      R objects (e.g., data frames of 25,000 items).  (PR#14698)

    * In a double-byte locale (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), grep() and
      friends might have used byte-wise matching of strings in the
      native encoding.  (PR#14622)

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.0:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The yLineBias of the windows() family of devices has been changed
      from 0.1 to 0.2: this changes slightly the vertical positioning
      of text (including axis annotations).  This can be overridden by
      setting the new "ylbias" graphical parameter.  This was done for
      consistency with other devices such as pdf().

    * R CMD build once again attempts to preserve file permissions on
      Windows.

    * There is support for cairographics-based devices using the same
      code as on Unix-alikes.  This can be selected by the new type
      argument of the bitmap devices bmp(), jpeg(), png() and tiff(),
      and devices svg(), cairo_pdf() and cairo_ps() are now available
      on Windows.

      These are not compiled in by default when building from source:
      see the instructions in the 'R Installation and Administration
      Manual'.

    * All the Windows-specific graphics devices now have a family
      argument.  If non-empty this specifies an initial family to be
      used for fonts 1-4.  If empty the fonts specified in the Rdevga
      configuration file are used for the Windows GDI devices and
      "sans" for cairographics-based devices.

      This will generally be a Windows font name such as "Lucida
      Bright" or one of the device-independent names ("sans", "serif"
      and "mono").  Outside Western Europe you may need to select a
      family that better supports your locale such as "Arial MS
      Unicode" or one specific to Chinese/Korean/Thai ....

    * There is a new antialias argument to windows(), win.print() and
      the bitmap devices.  This is an option that can be set in
      windows.options() to set the default for windows() (and
      win.graph()).

      This gives a hint to the Windows plotting system.  Whether
      anti-aliasing is actually used principally depends on the OS
      settings: this argument should at least be able to turn it off.
      The default behaviour (unchanged from before) is that Windows
      will use anti-aliasing for screen devices (and bitmap devices, as
      they plot on a hidden screen) if ClearType has been enabled.  For
      those not using ClearType, windows.options(antialias =
      "cleartype") will make this the default, and it will probably
      give more legible plots.

      The argument can also be used for the cairographics-based
      versions of the bitmap devices.

    * The 'Update packages ...' menu item now runs
      update.packages(ask="graphics", checkBuilt=TRUE).

    * R CMD INSTALL preserves the package-directory modification time
      when it restores an earlier install of the package.

    * File extensions .xz, .rda and .RData have been added to those
      which default to binary transfer for download.file().

    * install.packages() and R CMD check have a small delay after
      removing a directory to counteract some interference from
      anti-virus software.

    * There is a Danish translation of the RGui menus.

  INSTALLATION:

    * Compilation of C and Fortran code now uses the optimization flag
      -mtune=core2: this will improve performance a few percent on
      recent CPUs at the expense of those which are several years old.
      Its effect is particularly evident on 64-bit builds.

      This can be overridden when building from the sources: see the
      EOPTS macro defined in file MkRules.dist.

    * Where both 32- and 64-bit versions of R are installed, the file
      association for .RData files defaults to 64-bit R (it defaulted
      to 32-bit in R 2.12.x and 2.13.x).

    * There is preliminary support for 'multilib' toolchains which use
      options --m32 or --m64 to select the architecture; set the
      appropriate macros in MkRules.local.

      It is the intention to move to such a toolchain when they become
      mature enough.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * Rzlib.dll (sometimes used in packages _via_ $(ZLIB_LIBS)) does
      not include the buggy gzio interface from zlib 1.2.5.

  DEFUNCT:

    * zip.unpack() (deprecated in R 2.13.0) is defunct: use unzip()
      instead.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Raster drawing on win.metafile() (or copying a plot that includes
      a raster image from another device to a Metafile) now does not
      crash.  (Reported by Stefan Gelissen.)

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.13.2:

  BUG FIXES:

    * The fix for PR#14583 caused inconsistent behaviour in other
      areas, e.g. PR#14628, extra lines appearing in image displays,
      and uneven bases on histograms.  (PR#14632).

    * Opening large numbers of windows() graphics devices could cause
      some of them to fail to redraw (PR#14668).

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.13.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * R CMD build no longer attempts to preserve file permissions on
      Windows, because Windows (unlike POSIX-compliant OSes) stops
      read-only files being deleted in version-control directories.

    * shell.exec() now interprets files relative to the current working
      directory (rather than R_HOME).

    * file.info() now accepts 'file' names with trailing directory
      separators, even though such names are invalid on Windows.

    * The windows() family of devices now supports() per-pixel alpha
      for raster images.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Launching the PDF manuals from the Rgui menus did not work on
      some versions of Windows.

    * The windows() screen device would sometimes fail to plot
      (visibly) points with pch=".". PR#14583

    * system() and related functions sometimes failed when run in Rgui.

    * Saving to PDF from the menu of a windows() device used defaults
      for family, fg and bg from ps.options() rather than pdf.options()
      (but the factory-fresh defaults were the same).

    * Shutting down the R session cleaned up the temporary directory
      before closing all graphics devices.  On Windows this
      necessitated changing the working directory, so some devices
      (e.g., tiff()) could write files in the wrong directory if closed
      during shutdown.  The order has been reversed.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.13.0:

  WINDOWS VERSION:

    * Windows 2000 is no longer supported.  (It went end-of-life in
      July 2010.)

  NEW FEATURES:

    * win_iconv has been updated: this version has a change in the
      behaviour with BOMs on UTF-16 and UTF-32 files - it removes BOMs
      when reading and adds them when writing.  (This is consistent
      with Microsoft applications, but Unix versions of iconv usually
      ignore them.)

    * Support for repository type win64.binary (used for 64-bit Windows
      binaries for R 2.11.x only) has been removed.

    * The installers no longer put an 'Uninstall' item on the start
      menu (to conform to current Microsoft UI guidelines).

    * Running R always sets the environment variable R_ARCH (as it does
      on a Unix-alike from the shell-script front-end).

    * The defaults for options("browser") and options("pdfviewer") are
      now set from environment variables R_BROWSER and R_PDFVIEWER
      respectively (as on a Unix-alike).  A value of "false" suppresses
      display (even if there is no false.exe present on the path).

    * If options("install.lock") is set to TRUE, binary package
      installs are protected against failure similar to the way source
      package installs are protected.

    * file.exists() and unlink() have more support for files > 2GB.

    * The versions of R.exe in R_HOME/bin/i386,x64/bin now support
      options such as R --vanilla CMD: there is no comparable interface
      for Rcmd.exe.

    * A few more file operations will now work with >2GB files.

    * The environment variable R_HOME in an R session now uses slash as
      the path separator (as it always has when set by Rcmd.exe).

    * Rgui has a new menu item for the PDF 'Sweave User Manual'.

  DEPRECATED:

    * zip.unpack() is deprecated: use unzip().

  INSTALLATION:

    * There is support for libjpeg-turbo _via_ setting JPEGDIR to that
      value in MkRules.local.

      Support for jpeg-6b has been removed.

    * The sources now work with libpng-1.5.1, jpegsrc.v8c (which are
      used in the CRAN builds) and tiff-4.0.0beta6 (CRAN builds use
      3.9.1).  It is possible that they no longer work with older
      versions than libpng-1.4.5.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Workaround for the incorrect values given by Windows' casinh
      function on the branch cuts.

    * Bug fixes for drawing raster objects on windows().  The symptom
      was the occasional raster image not being drawn, especially when
      drawing multiple raster images in a single expression.  Thanks to
      Michael Sumner for report and testing.

    * Printing extremely long string values could overflow the stack
      and cause the GUI to crash.  (PR#14543)

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.2:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Building badly-written vignettes which used the default device
      (pdf(file = "Rplots.pdf")) could leave the device open and hence
      the file Rplots.pdf could not be removed on Windows: all devices
      are now closed.

  BUG FIXES:

    * In some circumstances the caret (cursor) could be positioned
      incorrectly. (PR#14460)

    * When loading Rconsole from disk, a spurious warning message was
      sometimes shown.

    * In R 2.12.1, system() sometimes passed an empty input stream to
      the new process rather than allowing user input.

    * The internal method for untar() does a better job of unravelling
      symbolic links in the tarball (but still with many limitations).

    * The graphical dialog version of select.list() could cause later
      dialogs to fail if Windows events were not processed between the
      calls.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * system() and system2() with output redirected to a character
      vector now give a warning if the command returns a non-zero error
      code.  (This is what a Unix-alike does as from R 2.12.0.)

    * system() and system2() no longer discard output from the command
      to stdout and stderr as often as they used to, and more cases of
      system2() are implemented.

    * stdout is now flushed after echoing the input line.

    * The internal implementation of tar() (package utils) is now
      supported on Windows.

  INSTALLATION:

    * The MSI installer is now made by an R script, and there is now
      support for 64-bit builds.  (Unlike the Inno Setup installer,
      there are separate MSI installers for 32- and 64-bit Windows.)

      It is now built using WiX 3.x rather than WiX 2.0.  (As a result
      it is about 25% smaller.)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Some warning/error messages from dyn.load() could be masked in
      Rgui on Windows 7, as that OS can return messages containing
      carriage returns and Rgui does not support overwriting.

    * Filenames could not be specified using backslashes in Sweave().

    * In R 2.12.0, system(intern = TRUE) captured stderr on Rterm when
      it was documented to only do so on Rgui.

    * Rgui in R 2.12.0 (only) did not always handle lines containing
      carriage returns (\r) correctly: sometimes random characters
      where shown.

      Since carriage returns have been supported in Rgui, the cursor
      positioning after outputting a line containing a carriage return
      had been unreliable.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.0:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * A sub-architecture is used for 32-bit (i386) as well as 64-bit
      (x64) builds.  32-bit packages containing compiled code need to
      re-installed for this release (64-bit packages built for 2.11.x
      will most likely still work).

      Architecture-specific files (such as Rgui.exe and Rscript.exe)
      are now in R_HOME/bin/i386 or R_HOME/bin/x64.

      Because many people expect it, there is an executable
      R_HOME/bin/R.exe, which accepts --arch and launches either
      R_HOME/bin/i386/R.exe or R_HOME/bin/x64/R.exe, and analogously
      for Rscript.exe.  If not specified by their argument --arch,
      these check the environment variable R_ARCH for the architecture
      to use.

    * The Rgui console now has an optional blinking caret (cursor) to
      assist screen readers for the visually impaired.

    * normalizePath() now signals a warning instead of an error when
      the input path does not exist.  It attempts partial
      normalization, or if that fails, returns the original input.

    * All the Rcmd sub-commands except config and Sd2d are now handled
      internally rather by shell scripts.

    * Rcmd has a new sub-command texify to run MiKTeX's texify.exe with
      arguments to find files such as Sweave.sty.  See the examples in
      ?Sweave.

    * system(intern = FALSE) now returns 127 (the same as Unix-alikes)
      rather than -1 if the command cannot be run, and (like
      Unix-alikes) no longer gives a warning.

    * Rscript -e and similar use a temporary file, and now work harder
      to ensure that filename is not the same as some other
      simultaneous R process.

  INSTALLATION:

    * The preferred toolchain for 32-bit builds (including packages) is
      now based on gcc 4.5.0: see the 'R Installation and
      Administration Manual'.

    * It is now possible to build R and the standard installer without
      Perl: only maintainer-mode tasks now need Perl.

  64-bit NEWS:

    * The 32- and 64-bit distributions have been merged:

      There is a combined installer (called R-<version>-win.exe).  When
      used under 32-bit Windows this works as before and installs
      32-bit R.  When used under 64-bit Windows there are options to
      install either or both of 32- and 64-bit R: the default is to
      install both.

      The default package type is "win.binary" on both 32- and 64-bit
      builds: a single repository contains binary packages for both
      architectures.  This is in place for CRAN, CRAN extras and BioC:
      type = "win64.binary" can still be used for any repositories
      which follow the R 2.11.x convention.  With the default filters
      (see ?available.packages) packages will only be offered if they
      are available for the current architecture.

      The default personal library, e.g. ~/R/win-library/2.12 is now
      the same for both 32- and 64-bit R.

    * The recommended 64-bit toolchain has been changed to one that
      does not add leading underscores.  See
      <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>.  Any static or
      import libraries for external software used in installing
      packages will need to be re-compiled for this toolchain, but the
      use of DLLs is unaffected.

    * For those building R from the sources, the 64-bit Tcl binary
      distribution for 2.12.x is in file R64a_Tcl_8-5-8.zip and
      contains e.g. directory Tcl/bin64 and not Tcl/bin.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * The deprecated environment variable RHOME is no longer set when a
      package is installed: use R_HOME instead (and depend on R (>=
      2.9) ).

    * Package installation, including configure.win scripts, can use
      ${R_HOME}/bin${R_ARCH_BIN} as a portable way to find the binaries
      such as Rscript.exe.

  BUG FIXES:

    * R.exe when used in place of Rterm.exe set the environment
      variables set by R CMD.  Conversely, R CMD BATCH did not.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.11.1 patched:

  BUG FIXES:

    * file.rename() now waits for the rename to complete before
      returning, so that operations on the new filename will not fail.

    * Sys.info() and win.version() now report Windows 7 as such (and
      not as Vista), and Sys.info() now reports the machine type as
      "x86-64" on 64-bit platforms.

    * serialize() to a raw vector works around the dismal performance
      of Windows' memory manager by allocating much larger chunks of
      memory less frequently.

    * readClipboard() could cause a segfault with certain clipboard
      data.

    * A fix intended for Mac OS X was incorrectly applied to Windows,
      so iconv(x, from, "") in a C locale was interpreted as requesting
      translation to UTF-8.

    * system(intern=TRUE) often returned 0 rather than an error status
      if the command could not be found, if run from Rterm or from Rgui
      with show.output.on.console = FALSE.

    * memory.limit() did not allow sizes greater than 4095 on 64 bit
      builds. (PR#14372)

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.11.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The Rgui console, pagers and editor on the 64-bit build now have
      a title bar icon.

    * The outer frame/console for Rgui/Rterm mentions '(64-bit)' to
      make it easier to distinguish running copies of R.

    * The package entries in listbox shown by the Install package(s)
      ... menu are now explicitly sorted in the current locale (as they
      were in most previous releases, but not in 2.11.0).

    * R CMD INSTALL can install zipfiles as binary packages.

    * Errors in the Rconsole file are ignored: silently on startup,
      with a warning when Rconsole is loaded interactively.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.11.0:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * There is now a native x64 Windows port, with a binary installer
      and binaries of packages available on CRAN.  See the 'R
      Administration and Installation Manual' and the 'R for Windows
      FAQ'.

    * Rcmd cmd (or R CMD cmd) now runs an arbitrary 'cmd' if 'cmd' is
      not one of the builtin commands, and does not have extension
      '.sh' or '.pl' (when it is run as a shell or Perl script
      respectively).  This is done by passing 'cmd' to the command
      interpreter determined by the COMSPEC environment variable (which
      in a vanilla Windows system points to cmd.exe).

    * X11() and x11() gain additional arguments to be more similar to
      the Unix X11() device.

    * file.rename() can work across volumes (by copy-and-delete).

    * The main HTML help page now links to this CHANGES file.
      (Suggested by Henrik Bengtsson.)

    * strftime(format = "%z") now gives the timezone names used by the
      Olson database and not those used by Windows.

    * iconv(to = "ASCII") no longer transliterates, but iconv(to =
      "ASCII//TRANSLIT") will.  This makes tools::showNonASCII() work
      the same way as on other platforms.

    * readRegistry() can look at either the 32- or 64-bit view of the
      Registry on 64-bit Windows.

  INSTALLATION:

    * The Tcl timezone files (3Mb on disc) are now an optional part of
      the installation: they would be very rarely used with R.

    * RSetReg.exe has been updated to (un)set the version-specific keys
      in the same way as the main installer, and to have the optional
      argument /Personal to (un)set the per-user rather than the
      per-machine keys (which need administrative access).

    * When building R, the recommended way is now to supply a file
      R_HOME/src/gnuwin32/MkRules.local instead of editing MkRules:
      there is now no MkRules file in the distribution, but one is
      generated during the build process.

      MkRules.local can be generated by copying and editing
      MkRules.dist.

    * The MSI installer defaults to an all-user (per machine) install
      (by setting the ALLUSERS property to 1).  This can be changed at
      installation, and it can be built for a user-mode install (see
      MkRules.dist).

  BUG FIXES:

    * Using ESC to interrupt a system() call could cause R to become
      unstable.

    * 0^1i (which should be complex NAN) was incorrect.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.10.1 patched:

  BUG FIXES:

    * Some of the MDI toolbar buttons (e.g., "Open Script") did not
      return the focus to the console if the user cancelled the action.

    * system() (and hence shell()) did not always set the standard file
      handles properly, so some programs would not run.

    * setWinProgressBar() did not check the type of its 'title' and
      'label' arguments and might have crashed if they were
      mis-specified.  It now does, thanks to a report by Greg Snow.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.10.1:

  BUG FIXES:

    * The installer did not properly record help type choices in
      R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site.

    * Rcmd INSTALL once again uses --no-restore, for consistency with
      the Unix version and R 2.9.2.

    * The HTML package index was not constructed properly when the
      library path was specified with backslashes.  (Patch submitted by
      Gabor Grothendieck.)

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.10.0:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * windows() now has a parameter fillOddEven (default TRUE), which
      controls the mode used for polygon fills of self-intersecting
      shapes.

    * The functions arrangeWindows() and getWindowsHandles() have been
      added to give more programmatic control to the appearance of
      windows in an R session.

    * A 'Windows' menu has been added to the SDI version of the R GUI,
      and the corresponding menu in the MDI version has been expanded
      slightly.

    * The libpng library has been updated to version 1.2.40.

    * The remaining Perl scripts build, check, Rprof, Sd2Rd in
      R_HOME/bin now have extension .pl.

    * Rcmd (or R CMD) can now run .sh (shell) and .pl (Perl) scripts
      anywhere on the path (as well as .bat and .exe files as before).

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * Rcmd SHLIB (which is used by Rcmd INSTALL) now calls make without
      a target, rather than target 'all'.  This is now the same as on
      Unix, and was announced in the NEWS file for 2.9.0.

    * Help files are no longer zipped: rendering as text, HTML, latex
      or examples is now done when needed.

      Options --use-zip and --use-zip-help in R CMD INSTALL are no
      longer available and --auto-zip only zips data (or not).

      Help in packages installed under 2.9.x may not work correctly,
      and a warning is given when such a package is attached by
      library().  Re-installation of all packages is strongly
      recommended (use update.packages(checkBuilt = TRUE)).

      Binary packages are installed without CHM help if they contain it
      (as those intended for 2.9.x may).

    * It is possible to install source packages without Rtools provided
      they have no compiled code and no configure.win or cleanup.win
      script.

  INSTALLATION:

    * Support for memory profiling is enabled in a standard build (this
      can be changed by editing config.h).

    * CHM help is no longer supported.

    * The help default for the standard installer is HTML help rather
      than CHM help.

    * The categories in the installers have been simplified.  Now the
      files to support installation of source packages are always
      installed (they are now only 0.7Mb), and there are no longer
      categories 'chtml', 'html/help', 'latex' and 'Rd'.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Rcmd open now works as documented: previously Rcmd open.exe was
      required.

    * cat(x, file=) in Rgui tried to interpret UTF-8-encoded strings
      for the console rather than converting them to the native
      encoding.
